# Car

This is a project that creates a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, it allows the user to define some instance variables that tell the year, color, model of the car and it's current speed as well. The class methods allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.
The method called spray_paint can be called on an object and will modify the color of the car.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'car'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install car

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
